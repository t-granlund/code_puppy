[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Current reasoning:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Based on my discovery, I can see:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Project State:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • Control Tower is an Azure/M365 management dashboard project
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • BUILD.md shows M1 (Wire Collectors to API) is marked 100% complete
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • But control-tower-ap6 is still marked IN_PROGRESS in bd (inconsistency!)
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • 420 tests passing according to BUILD.md
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • 26 API route files exist in backend/api/routes/
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Current Issues (from bd ready):
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-ap6 (P0) - Wire Collectors to API - marked IN_PROGRESS but BUILD.md says complete
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-9xm (P1) - Frontend Modernization - IN_PROGRESS
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-7a1 (P1) - Database Migration Strategy - OPEN
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-6ml (P1) - Monitoring & Alerting - OPEN
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-a2q (P1) - PIM Collector - IN_PROGRESS
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-53p (P1) - BI Infrastructure Collector - IN_PROGRESS
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • control-tower-avf (P1) - Wire Policy Collector - IN_PROGRESS
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  • Several P2 issues
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Inconsistencies to Resolve:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  1 BUILD.md says M1 is 100% complete but bd still shows ap6 as IN_PROGRESS
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  2 Need to verify the actual test status
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  3 Need to determine next actions
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Next Steps:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  1 Run tests to verify current state
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  2 If M1 is truly complete, close ap6 and update bd
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  3 Determine which milestone to work on next (M2 or M3)
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  4 Delegate implementation work to appropriate agents
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01] Planned next steps:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  1 Run pytest to verify test status
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  2 Reconcile BUILD.md with bd issue statuses
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  3 Close ap6 if verified complete
[02/04/2026, 23:00:01]  4 Start next milestone (M2: Frontend Dashboards or M3: Missing Collectors)

[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     This issue needs to create FastAPI routes that:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     1. Import existing collectors from backend/collector/
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     2. Create HTTP endpoints that call collector.collect_all_*() methods
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     3. Return JSON responses with collector data
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     EXAMPLE ENDPOINTS NEEDED:
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     - GET /api/v1/identity/users -> UserCollector.collect_all_users()
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     - GET /api/v1/identity/groups -> GroupCollector.collect_all_groups()
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     - GET /api/v1/devices -> DeviceCollector.collect_all_devices()
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     - GET /api/v1/licensing/overview -> LicenseCollector.collect_licenses()
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     - etc.
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     PATTERN: Look at existing working endpoints in backend/api/ for reference.
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     NOTE: This issue should NOT be blocked by control-tower-w4h since collectors exist.
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     The dependency can be removed or updated to 'Ensure collector pattern is documented'.
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]
[02/04/2026, 23:00:59]     REFERENCE: docs/COLLECTOR_ACTUAL_PATTERN.md shows how to call each collector.
