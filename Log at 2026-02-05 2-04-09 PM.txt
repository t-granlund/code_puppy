[02/05/2026, 13:49:31] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31] User wants me to merge feature/control-tower-0it into main. Following the Retriever merge workflow:
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  1 Check current git status and fetch latest
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  2 Switch to main branch
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  3 Pull latest changes from origin/main
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  4 Merge feature branch with --no-ff flag to preserve history
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  5 Push to origin
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  6 Verify the merge success
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]  7 Report back with commit hash and confirmation
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31] Pre-flight checks confirmed: code review done, tests passing (23/23), no conflicts expected.
[02/05/2026, 13:49:31]

[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]
[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]  Good, I can see the worktree has uncommitted files:
[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]  - docker-compose.dev.yml
[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]  - docker/ directory
[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]  - docs/ directory (which likely contains monitoring.md)
[02/05/2026, 14:01:11]
[02/05/2026, 14:01:12]  Now let me dispatch husky to this worktree to complete the monitoring setup. The task is to:
[02/05/2026, 14:01:12]  1. Create Prometheus configuration
[02/05/2026, 14:01:12]  2. Create Grafana dashboards for API/database/collectors
[02/05/2026, 14:01:13]  3. Create alert rules (error rate >5%, p95 >1s, collector failures)
[02/05/2026, 14:01:13]
[02/05/2026, 14:01:13]  Let me invoke husky to work on this.
