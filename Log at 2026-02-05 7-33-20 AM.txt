[02/05/2026, 06:58:49] 1. **Worktrees exist for all 3 dashboard tasks:**

[02/05/2026, 06:59:14]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:14] 1. **fyt worktree** has `InventoryCoverage.tsx` component created (1412 bytes) - this is real progress!
[02/05/2026, 06:59:14]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:15] 2. **eya worktree** has a frontend structure with Components/Changes, Compliance, Dashboard, Layout directories - looks like there's more there than git status showed
[02/05/2026, 06:59:15]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:15] 3. The worktrees/ directory doesn't exist at all - those "prunable" worktrees were just git metadata pointing to non-existent paths
[02/05/2026, 06:59:15]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:16] Let me look at the actual content of the InventoryCoverage component and see what needs to be done to complete these tasks. Also, let me check if there's a tag compliance component in the eya worktree.

[02/05/2026, 06:59:21]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:22] 1. **fyt worktree**: Has a partial `InventoryCoverage.tsx` component (1412 bytes, truncated in read). It's using the dashboard structure with API calls.
[02/05/2026, 06:59:22]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23] 2. **eya worktree**: Has a complete `TagCompliance.tsx` component (12784 bytes - that's a substantial component!) and also has backend routes for tags.
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23] So actually, there's significant work already done in both worktrees! The issue is:
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23] - The work is uncommitted
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23] - The tasks are still marked IN_PROGRESS
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23] - Need to verify completeness and commit/merge
[02/05/2026, 06:59:23]
[02/05/2026, 06:59:24] Let me check if these components are complete and what else needs to be done.

That's fine - they're optional fields (note the `?` in the type definition), so adding them won't break anything.

[02/05/2026, 07:06:16]  THINKING  ⚡  Now I have a much clearer picture. The project is quite mature with extensive documentation and a Pack Leader session state showing we're in the middle of a large multi-wave implementation. The key f[02/05/2026, 07:06:16] indings:
[02/05/2026, 07:06:16]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:16] 1. **Project**: Control Tower - Azure Governance Platform
[02/05/2026, 07:06:17] 2. **Current State**: Pack Leader session is active, Wave 1-7 complete, Wave 8 (AI Insights) needs to be re-implemented
[02/05/2026, 07:06:17] 3. **Active Issues**: There are bd issues being tracked
[02/05/2026, 07:06:18] 4. **Lots of documentation exists** - many .md files tracking progress
[02/05/2026, 07:06:18]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:18] Let me now check the bd issue tracker to understand current work status, and also look at the AGENT_TASK_QUEUE.md and PACK_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md to understand what's ready for wiggum.
[02/05/2026, 07:06:18]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:19] I should also check if there's an epistemic state file already.

[02/05/2026, 07:06:20]  Now I have a clearer picture. This is an active Control Tower project with Pack Leader orchestration in progress. Let me check the bd issue tracker, agent task queue, and any existing epistemic state:

[02/05/2026, 07:06:32] **What's Missing for Wiggum:**
[02/05/2026, 07:06:32] Looking at the epistemic pipeline, I need to:
[02/05/2026, 07:06:32] 1. Check if epistemic/state.json exists
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33] 2. Check if BUILD.md exists with milestones
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33] 3. Check auth requirements
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33] 4. Update documentation to reflect current state
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33] 5. Prepare for autonomous execution
[02/05/2026, 07:06:33]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:34] I'll focus on three critical tasks: creating essential epistemic documentation, verifying authentication protocols, and ensuring comprehensive documentation readiness. This means checking for key configuration file[02/05/2026, 07:06:34] s, validating access credentials, and confirming all necessary documentation is in place before moving forward with autonomous execution.

[02/05/2026, 07:06:38]  THINKING  ⚡ Now I have a clear picture. The project is quite mature but lacks the epistemic infrastructure for wiggum mode. Key findings:
[02/05/2026, 07:06:38]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:38] **What exists:**
[02/05/2026, 07:06:39] - Full backend structure (FastAPI, collectors, database)
[02/05/2026, 07:06:39] - 4 tenants configured (HTT Brands, BCC, FN, TLL)
[02/05/2026, 07:06:39] - Pack Leader session state with active issues
[02/05/2026, 07:06:39] - Extensive documentation (AGENT_TASK_QUEUE, PACK_EXECUTION_MATRIX)
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] - bd issue tracker with 8 ready issues
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] **What's missing for wiggum:**
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] 1. No epistemic/ directory
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] 2. No BUILD.md with milestones
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] 3. No epistemic/state.json
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] 4. No auth-checklist.json
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:40] **Current work status:**
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41] - 8 issues in "ready" state (some marked in_progress)
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41] - No blocked issues
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41] - Waves 1-7 complete, Wave 8 needs re-execution
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41] - 62% agent readiness per execution matrix
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:41] To prepare for wiggum, I need to:
[02/05/2026, 07:06:42] 1. Create epistemic directory structure
[02/05/2026, 07:06:42] 2. Create epistemic/state.json from discovered state
[02/05/2026, 07:06:43] 3. Create BUILD.md from the existing agent task queue
[02/05/2026, 07:06:43] 4. Run preflight auth check
[02/05/2026, 07:06:43] 5. Update PACK_LEADER_SESSION_STATE.md to reflect current status
[02/05/2026, 07:06:43]
[02/05/2026, 07:06:44] Let me start by creating the epistemic state and BUILD.md to enable wiggum mode.

[02/05/2026, 07:08:39]  The auth checklist shows:
[02/05/2026, 07:08:39]  - ✅ Azure CLI authentication passed (tyler.granlund-admin@httbrands.com)
[02/05/2026, 07:08:39]  - ❌ Docker not available (this is expected in local dev)
[02/05/2026, 07:08:39]
[02/05/2026, 07:08:40]  Since Docker is only needed for containerization (which may not be critical for wiggum mode), and Azure auth is working, we might be able to proceed. Let me create the CHECKPOINT.md to track progress and update th[02/05/2026, 07:08:40] e auth checklist to note that Docker is optional for this phase.

[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  AGENT REASONING
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Understanding the Task
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] I need to create a frontend tag compliance page for the Control Tower dashboard. Based on my exploration:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Backend API Found ✅
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] There's already a /api/tags/compliance endpoint in backend/api/routes/tags.py that returns:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • compliance_pct: Percentage of resources with all required tags
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • violations: List of resources with missing tags (max 50)
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • required_tags: ["Owner", "CostCenter", "Environment"]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • resources_checked: Total number of resources checked
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • tenant_filter: Optional tenant filter
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Frontend Architecture
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] The frontend follows a modular structure:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • frontend/templates/index.html - Main dashboard template
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • frontend/static/js/app.js - Main app controller
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • frontend/static/js/views/*.js - Individual view files
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • frontend/static/js/utils.js - Utility functions
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • frontend/static/js/charts.js - Chart.js visualizations
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Implementation Plan
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  1 Create tag compliance view (frontend/static/js/views/tag-compliance.js)
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Load compliance data from /api/tags/compliance
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Display compliance percentage with visual gauge
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Show violation table with sortable columns
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Add tenant filtering
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Export functionality
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  2 Update main app (frontend/static/js/app.js)
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Add navigation link
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Register the view
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Add routing
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  3 Update template (frontend/templates/index.html)
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Add HTML structure for tag compliance section
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]     • Add navigation menu item
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Design Approach
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Following the purple theme:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • Use same color palette as other views
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • Similar layout structure (summary cards + detail tables)
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • Tenant filter dropdown in header
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • Search functionality for violations
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  • Export button for reporting
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] The implementation will match the existing patterns in cost-compliance.js and inventory.js views.
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  1 Create frontend/static/js/views/tag-compliance.js with view controller
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  2 Update frontend/static/js/app.js to register the new view
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  3 Update frontend/templates/index.html to add navigation and HTML structure
[02/05/2026, 07:13:53]  4 Test the page loads and displays data correctly

[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  AGENT REASONING
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02] I have established the worktree and explored the backend structure. The task requires creating demo data, a script, talking points, and a loader script. I'll follow the husky pattern: create a 'demo' directory and
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02] populate it with the required files. I need to ensure the data is representative of the 'Control Tower' platform's capabilities (Azure/Entra governance).
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  1 Create the /demo directory structure
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  2 Define sample data in JSON files (tenants, resources, costs, policies, identities)
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  3 Draft the Persona Talking Points (FinOps, CISO, etc.)
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  4 Draft the 5-minute Demo Script walkthrough
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  5 Implement the load_demo_data.py script to populate the database
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  6 Write a README.md for the demo folder
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  7 Verify the data loading script works
[02/05/2026, 07:14:02]  8 Commit and push the changes

[02/05/2026, 07:14:13]  THINKING  ⚡  I'm getting errors invoking the husky agents. These look like infrastructure/API issues with the agent system, not issues with the tasks themselves. Let me try a different approach - I'll use the ter[02/05/2026, 07:14:13] rier agent to set up worktrees, then try invoking husky again, or I could try running the commands directly.
[02/05/2026, 07:14:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:14:14] Actually, let me first check what agents are available and maybe try a different approach. I could also try using shell commands to check the worktree status and proceed with a more direct approach.

[02/05/2026, 07:14:14] 2. Update the issues to in_progress
[02/05/2026, 07:14:15] 3. Then try invoking agents again or delegate differently

[02/05/2026, 07:15:42]  The agent invocation failed due to infrastructure issues. Let me try a different approach:
[02/05/2026, 07:15:43]  1. First set up worktrees for the other tasks using terrier
[02/05/2026, 07:15:43]  2. Then try invoking agents again with simpler payloads

[02/05/2026, 07:15:52] My initial attempt to invoke husky agents failed with connection/API errors. This appears to be an infrastructure issue with the agent system, not the tasks themselves.
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52] New plan:
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  1 Use terrier agent to set up missing worktrees for all 8 issues
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  2 Then dispatch tasks to husky agents with simpler approach
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  3 Monitor and iterate through the wiggum loop
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  1 Invoke terrier to set up worktrees for all 8 issues
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  2 Check which agents are available
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  3 Dispatch tasks with simpler payloads
[02/05/2026, 07:15:52]  4 Monitor progress through wiggum iterations

[02/05/2026, 07:15:54]  Good, I can see all the agents including:
[02/05/2026, 07:15:54]  - terrier (worktree management)
[02/05/2026, 07:15:54]  - husky (task execution)

[02/05/2026, 07:15:55]
[02/05/2026, 07:15:55]  Let me try invoking the terrier agent to set up worktrees. I'll try with a simpler payload this time.

[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] I successfully created 8 worktrees for all requested issues in /Users/tygranlund/dev/control-tower/worktrees/. Here's what was done:
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Created 4 NEW branches + worktrees:
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  1 worktrees/control-tower-7a1 → feature/control-tower-7a1-db-migration-strategy
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  2 worktrees/control-tower-6ml → feature/control-tower-6ml-monitoring-alerting-setup
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  3 worktrees/control-tower-lfu → feature/control-tower-lfu-changes-timeline-view
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  4 worktrees/control-tower-553 → feature/control-tower-553-persona-switcher-ui
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Created 1 worktree for existing branch: 5. worktrees/control-tower-0it → feature/control-tower-0it-insights-engine
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Reused existing worktree in worktrees/: 6. worktrees/control-tower-eya → feature/control-tower-eya (already existed)
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Created 2 new branches with -v2 suffix (originals were checked out elsewhere): 7. worktrees/control-tower-fyt → feature/control-tower-fyt-inventory-coverage-dashboard-v2 8. worktrees/control-tower-e4w →
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] feature/control-tower-e4w-v2
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] All worktrees are based on the main branch and ready for development work!
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  1 Husky can now work in all 8 parallel worktrees
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  2 Each worktree has its own isolated working directory and branch
[02/05/2026, 07:16:40]  3 All worktrees are located in /Users/tygranlund/dev/control-tower/worktrees/

[02/05/2026, 07:16:48]  I'll group them by the parallel execution groups from the session state:

[02/05/2026, 07:20:03]  THINKING  ⚡  All 4 husky agent invocations failed with connection errors. This is clearly an infrastructure issue with the agent system. The errors show:
[02/05/2026, 07:20:03]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:04] 1. `RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection without sending complete message body` - HTTP connection issues
[02/05/2026, 07:20:04] 2. `RuntimeError: generator didn't stop after athrow()` - Async generator issues
[02/05/2026, 07:20:04]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:05] This appears to be a systemic problem with the agent invocation system, not with my approach. Let me try a different strategy:
[02/05/2026, 07:20:05]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:06] 1. Try using the code-puppy agent instead (it's described as "the most loyal digital puppy, helping with all coding tasks")
[02/05/2026, 07:20:06] 2. Or try using python-programmer which might be more stable
[02/05/2026, 07:20:06] 3. Or report this as a blocking issue and update the checkpoint
[02/05/2026, 07:20:06]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:07] Let me try invoking a different agent to see if the issue is husky-specific or system-wide.

[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  AGENT REASONING
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13] Alright Tyler! Time to tackle this database migration strategy for SQLite → PostgreSQL. This is a juicy task!
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13] Here's my plan:
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   1 Update the bd issue status to in_progress first
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   2 Explore the current worktree to understand the existing SQLite schema and structure
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   3 Check existing database models/schema files
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   4 Create comprehensive migration scripts
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   5 Document the backup/restore procedures
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   6 Add data integrity validation tools
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   7 Create zero-downtime migration plan documentation
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   8 Document rollback procedures
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]   9 Add performance benchmarking tools
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13] Let me start by claiming the issue and exploring the codebase!
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  1 Update bd issue to in_progress
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  2 Explore worktree structure
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  3 Examine existing SQLite schema
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  4 Create migration scripts
[02/05/2026, 07:20:13]  5 Document procedures

[02/05/2026, 07:21:45]  THINKING  ⚡  All agents are failing with the same HTTP connection error. This is clearly a systemic infrastructure issue, not specific to any particular agent. The error `RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connecti[02/05/2026, 07:21:45] on without sending complete message body` suggests the agent service is having connectivity issues.
[02/05/2026, 07:21:45]
[02/05/2026, 07:21:45] Given this situation, I have a few options:
[02/05/2026, 07:21:46] 1. Continue trying different agents hoping one works
[02/05/2026, 07:21:46] 2. Report this as a blocker and stop the wiggum loop
[02/05/2026, 07:21:46] 3. Try a different approach entirely
[02/05/2026, 07:21:46]
[02/05/2026, 07:21:47] Since ALL agents are failing with the same HTTP error, I should:
[02/05/2026, 07:21:47] 1. Update the CHECKPOINT.md to reflect this blocking infrastructure issue
[02/05/2026, 07:21:47] 2. Document the state of the work (worktrees created but agents can't execute)
[02/05/2026, 07:21:48] 3. Stop the wiggum loop with a clear explanation
[02/05/2026, 07:21:48] 4. Recommend next steps for the user
[02/05/2026, 07:21:48]
[02/05/2026, 07:21:48] This is the responsible approach when facing infrastructure issues that prevent task execution.

[02/05/2026, 07:21:48]  AGENT RESPONSE
[02/05/2026, 07:21:56]  The agent invocation system is experiencing infrastructure issues (HTTP connection errors). All agents are failing with the same RemoteProtocolError. Let me update the checkpoint and provide a clear status report:

[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] Current reasoning:
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] After attempting to invoke multiple agents (husky x4, code-puppy x1), ALL invocations failed with the same infrastructure error:
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection without sending complete message body (incomplete chunked read)
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] This is clearly a systemic issue with the agent service/LLM provider connection, not with the tasks or my approach.
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] Progress made:
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]

[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]  1 Update CHECKPOINT.md with this blocker status
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]  2 Stop the wiggum loop with clear documentation
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]  3 Provide the user with the current state so they can resume when infrastructure is fixed
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02] Planned next steps:
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]  1 Update CHECKPOINT.md with blocker status
[02/05/2026, 07:22:02]  2 Document the 8 ready worktrees

[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + ## 🔧 RESOLUTION OPTIONS
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + ### Option 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Infrastructure may self-resolve
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Retry agent invocation in 5-10 minutes
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Check `invoke_agent` with simple test prompt
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + ### Option 2: Direct Shell Execution
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Skip agent layer, run tasks directly via `agent_run_shell_command`
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Requires manual task breakdown
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Loses parallel agent coordination benefits
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + ### Option 3: Restart Agent Services
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - If running local agent services, restart them
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Check network connectivity to LLM providers
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Verify API keys and rate limits
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + ### Option 4: Degrade to Single-Agent Mode
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Use `python-programmer` or `code-puppy` if they recover
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Process issues sequentially instead of parallel
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + - Slower but may bypass systemic issues

[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + When infrastructure is restored:
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 1. **Test Agent Connectivity**
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    ```python
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    # Try simple invocation first
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    invoke_agent("terrier", "Test connectivity - list worktrees")
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    ```
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 2. **Verify Issue State**
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    ```bash
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    bd ready  # Should still show 8 issues
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    ```
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 3. **Dispatch Parallel Tasks**
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    - Group A (UI): control-tower-eya, control-tower-553, control-tower-e4w
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    - Group B (Database): control-tower-7a1, control-tower-fyt

[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    - Group D (Infrastructure): control-tower-6ml
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 4. **Resume Wiggum Loop**
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    - Run `/wiggum` command
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] +    - Continue OODA iterations

[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + If infrastructure issues persist:
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 1. Check agent service logs
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 2. Verify LLM provider status page
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 3. Consider manual task execution
[02/05/2026, 07:23:29] + 4. Document blockers in project issues

[02/05/2026, 07:23:44]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:44]  1. ✅ Terrier successfully created 8 worktrees with isolated branches
[02/05/2026, 07:23:44]  2. 🔴 Agent execution failed - All invocations (husky, code-puppy) failed with:
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45] RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection without sending complete message body
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45]  3. 🔴 Root cause: LLM provider connectivity issue (OpenAI/Cerebras streaming)
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45] Current State
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:45] All 8 worktrees are ready and waiting:
[02/05/2026, 07:23:46] • P1: control-tower-7a1 (Database Migration), control-tower-6ml (Monitoring)
[02/05/2026, 07:23:47] • P2: control-tower-0it (Insights), control-tower-fyt (Inventory), control-tower-eya (Tag Compliance), control-tower-lfu (Changes Timeline)
[02/05/2026, 07:23:47] • P3: control-tower-553 (Persona Switcher), control-tower-e4w (Demo Script)

[02/05/2026, 07:23:47] Resumption Options
[02/05/2026, 07:23:47]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:47] Option 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)
[02/05/2026, 07:23:47]  bash ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[02/05/2026, 07:23:48] # Wait 5-10 minutes for infrastructure to recover
[02/05/2026, 07:23:48] # Then retry agent invocation
[02/05/2026, 07:23:48] ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[02/05/2026, 07:23:48]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:48] Option 2: Manual Execution
[02/05/2026, 07:23:49] If agents don't recover, I can execute tasks directly via shell commands instead of delegating to husky agents.
[02/05/2026, 07:23:49]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:49] Option 3: Check bd Status

[02/05/2026, 07:23:50]
[02/05/2026, 07:23:50] When you're ready to resume:
[02/05/2026, 07:23:50]  4. Test: Run /wiggum again to retry agent invocation
[02/05/2026, 07:23:51]  5. Verify: I'll check if agents respond before dispatching
[02/05/2026, 07:23:51]  6. Dispatch: Resume parallel execution of the 8 ready issues
[02/05/2026, 07:23:51]

[02/05/2026, 07:23:51] The worktrees and issue tracking state are preserved - we just need the agent infrastructure to recover to continue execution.
