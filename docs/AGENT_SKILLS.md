## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are pre-packaged capabilities that can be dynamically discovered, loaded, and used by agents. They consist of:

- **SKILL.md** - The main instruction file with YAML frontmatter metadata
- **Resources** - Optional supporting files (templates, examples, configs)
- **Metadata** - Name, description, version, author, and tags

Skills enable you to:

- 📦 Share reusable workflows and best practices
- 🎯 Give agents specialized knowledge for specific tasks
- 🔌 Extend functionality without modifying core code
- 🏗️ Build domain-specific expertise (DevOps, security, testing, etc.)

---

## Installing Skills

Skills are installed by placing them in designated skill directories. Code Puppy scans these directories at startup to discover available skills.

### Default Skill Directories

By default, Code Puppy looks for skills in:

1. **`~/.code_puppy/skills/`** - User-level skills (global)
2. **`./skills/`** - Project-level skills (local)

### Installation Steps

1. **Create the skills directory** (if it doesn't exist):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.code_puppy/skills
   ```

2. **Download or clone a skill** into the directory:

   ```bash
   # Example: Installing a docker skill
   cd ~/.code_puppy/skills
   git clone https://github.com/example/code-puppy-docker.git docker
   
   # Or manually create the skill directory
   mkdir my-custom-skill
   ```

3. **Verify the skill** has a `SKILL.md` file:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.code_puppy/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Refresh skill discovery**:

   ```
   /skills refresh
   ```

### Skill Directory Structure

```
~/.code_puppy/skills/
├── docker/
│   ├── SKILL.md          # Required: Skill instructions + metadata
│   ├── docker-compose.yml # Optional: Supporting resource
│   └── Dockerfile.template # Optional: Supporting resource
├── kubernetes/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── k8s-templates/
└── security-audit/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── audit-checklist.md
```

## Using the /skills TUI Menu

Code Puppy provides an interactive TUI (Text User Interface) for managing skills.

### Launching the Menu

```
/skills
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can browse, enable, disable, and configure skills.

### Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/skills` | Launch the interactive TUI menu |
| `/skills list` | List all discovered skills |

## How Skills Work

Skills integrate with agents through two mechanisms: **prompt injection** and **dedicated tools**.

### 1. Prompt Injection

When skills are enabled, Code Puppy automatically injects available skills into the system prompt:

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>docker</name>
    <description>Expert guidance for Docker containerization, Dockerfile optimization, and docker-compose orchestration</description>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>kubernetes</name>
    <description>Kubernetes deployment patterns, manifest generation, and cluster management</description>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

This tells the agent what skills are available without loading their full content.

### 2. Skill Tools

Agents have access to two dedicated tools for working with skills:

#### `list_or_search_skills`

Lists all available skills, optionally filtered by a search query.

**When to use:**
- At the start of a task to see what's available
- When you need to find a skill matching specific keywords

**Example:**
```python
# List all skills
list_or_search_skills()

# Search for docker-related skills
list_or_search_skills(query="docker")
```

**Returns:**
- `skills`: List of skill metadata (name, description, path, tags)
- `total_count`: Total number of skills found
- `query`: The search query (if provided)

#### `activate_skill`

Loads and activates a specific skill by name.

**When to use:**
- When a user's task matches a skill's description
- To load the full instructions for a specific capability

**Example:**
```python
activate_skill(skill_name="docker")
```

**Returns:**
- `skill_name`: Name of the activated skill
- `content`: Full SKILL.md content (including instructions)
- `resources`: List of available resource files
- `error`: Error message (if activation failed)

### Skill Activation Flow

1. **Discovery** → Code Puppy scans skill directories at startup
2. **Prompt Injection** → Available skills are listed in the system prompt
3. **User Request** → User asks for help with a specific domain
4. **Skill Selection** → Agent identifies the relevant skill
5. **Activation** → Agent calls `activate_skill(skill_name="...")`
6. **Execution** → Agent follows the loaded skill instructions

---

## Creating Your Own Skills

Creating a skill is straightforward. You need a directory with at least one file: `SKILL.md`.

### SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file uses **YAML frontmatter** for metadata followed by **Markdown content** for instructions.

```markdown
---
name: docker-expert
description: Expert guidance for Docker containerization, multi-stage builds, and compose orchestration
version: 1.0.0
author: Your Name
tags:
  - docker
  - containers
  - devops
  - deployment
---

# Docker Expert Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs help with:
- Writing or optimizing Dockerfiles
- Setting up docker-compose configurations
- Container best practices and security
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images

## Instructions

### 1. Dockerfile Best Practices

Always follow these principles:

- Use specific base image tags (not `latest`)
- Leverage multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Combine RUN commands to reduce layers
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

### 2. Security Guidelines

- Run containers as non-root users
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Minimize installed packages
- Use distroless or slim base images when possible

### 3. Common Patterns

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
USER node
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Available Tools

When this skill is activated, you can use standard file tools to:
- Create Dockerfiles
- Generate docker-compose.yml files
- Set up .dockerignore

## Resources

This skill includes:
- `docker-compose.yml.template` - Starter compose template
- `.dockerignore.example` - Common ignore patterns
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | ✅ Yes | Unique skill identifier (kebab-case recommended) |
| `description` | string | ✅ Yes | Brief description of what the skill does |
| `version` | string | ❌ No | Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0") |
| `author` | string | ❌ No | Author name or email |
| `tags` | list | ❌ No | List of keywords for categorization |

### Frontmatter Examples

**Minimal (required only):**
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful
---
```

**Complete (all fields):**
```yaml
---
name: python-testing
description: Comprehensive Python testing with pytest, including fixtures, mocks, and coverage
version: 2.1.0
author: Jane Developer <jane@example.com>
tags:
  - python
  - testing
  - pytest
  - quality
---
```

### Including Resources

You can bundle additional files with your skill. Place them in the same directory as `SKILL.md`:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required
├── template.py           # Optional resource
├── config.yaml           # Optional resource
└── examples/
    └── sample.json       # Optional resource
```

These resources are listed when the skill is activated via the `resources` field in the output.

### Skill Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `docker-compose`, `python-testing`)
- Keep names **descriptive but concise**
- Avoid generic names like `utils` or `helpers`
- Prefix domain-specific skills (e.g., `aws-s3`, `gcp-cloudrun`)

### Testing Your Skill

1. Place your skill in `~/.code_puppy/skills/`
2. Run `/skills refresh`
3. Verify it appears in `/skills list`
4. Test activation by asking an agent to use it

---

## Configuration Options

Agent Skills can be configured through Code Puppy's configuration system.

### Configuration Keys

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `skills_enabled` | boolean | `true` | Globally enable/disable skills integration |
| `skill_directories` | JSON list | `["~/.code_puppy/skills", "./skills"]` | Directories to scan for skills |
| `disabled_skills` | JSON list | `[]` | List of skill names to disable |

### Setting Configuration Values

Use the `/set` command to configure skills:

```
# Disable skills integration entirely
/set skills_enabled = false

# Enable skills integration
/set skills_enabled = true

# Add a custom skill directory
/set skill_directories = "[\"/path/to/skills\", \"~/.code_puppy/skills\"]"

# Disable specific skills
/set disabled_skills = "[\"skill-one\", \"skill-two\"]"
```

### Managing Skill Directories

You can also manage directories via the TUI:

```
/skills directories
```

This shows:
```
Skill Directories:
  1. ✓ /home/user/.code_puppy/skills
  2. ✓ /path/to/project/skills
  3. ✗ /old/path (does not exist)

Commands:
  add <path>        - Add a skill directory
  remove <num>      - Remove directory by number
  list              - List directories
  back              - Return to main menu
```

### Configuration File Location

Settings are stored in `~/.code_puppy/puppy.cfg`:

```ini
[puppy]
skills_enabled = true
skill_directories = ["/home/user/.code_puppy/skills", "./skills"]
disabled_skills = ["deprecated-skill"]
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important:** Skills execute with the same permissions as Code Puppy. Follow these security best practices:

### Skill Sources

- **Only install skills from trusted sources**
- Review skill content before installing
- Be cautious with skills that request elevated permissions
- Prefer skills from verified repositories or official sources

### Skill Content

- **Review SKILL.md** before using a new skill
- Check what tools and commands the skill uses
- Be wary of skills that:
  - Execute arbitrary shell commands
  - Access sensitive files or environment variables
  - Make network requests to unknown endpoints
  - Modify system configurations

### File System Access

Skills can access:
- Files within their own directory
- The project working directory
- Any files Code Puppy has access to

**Recommendation:** Run Code Puppy with minimal necessary permissions.

### Network Security

Skills may include instructions that:
- Download resources from the internet
- Call external APIs
- Clone repositories

**Best practice:** Review any URLs or network operations in skill instructions.

### Sandboxing Recommendations

For maximum security:

1. **Use a dedicated environment** (container, VM, or restricted user)
2. **Limit file system access** to only necessary directories
3. **Monitor network activity** when using new skills
4. **Keep skills updated** to receive security patches
5. **Disable unused skills** to reduce attack surface

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in a skill:

1. Disable the skill immediately: `/skills disable <skill-name>`
2. Report to the skill author
3. For core skills functionality issues, report to Code Puppy

### Skill Verification

Before installing a skill, verify:

- [ ] Source is trustworthy (official repo, known author)
- [ ] SKILL.md content is reviewed
- [ ] No suspicious shell commands or network calls
- [ ] Resource files are safe (no binaries, scripts are reviewed)
- [ ] Skill is actively maintained

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of using Agent Skills:

```bash
# 1. Start Code Puppy
code-puppy

# 2. Check available skills
/skills list

# 3. Start a conversation with an agent
/agent code-puppy

# 4. The agent automatically knows about available skills
# When you ask for docker help, it activates the docker skill

# User: Help me containerize this Python app
# Agent: I'll help you containerize this Python app. Let me activate the docker skill first.
# [Agent calls activate_skill(skill_name="docker")]
# [Agent follows skill instructions to create Dockerfile, .dockerignore, docker-compose.yml]
```
