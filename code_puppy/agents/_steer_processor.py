"""History processor that injects queued steering messages into agent runs.

When the user presses Ctrl+T and submits a steering message, the message
lands in ``PauseController``'s steer queue. This processor — wired into the
agent's ``history_processors`` list AFTER compaction — drains the queue on
every model call and appends pending steers as user messages right before
the model sees them.

Effect: the model sees the steer as if the user had naturally followed up
with a new message, on the next model invocation within the same
``agent.run()``. No cancellation, no lost work, mid-turn pivots Just Work.

Why a history processor (and not the runtime's between-turns while-loop)?
Because ``agent.run()`` is atomic across a multi-tool-call turn — it doesn't
return until the model decides it's done. The old between-turns approach
left steers stuck in the queue for the entire duration of a long turn.
``history_processors`` fire before EVERY model call (including between
tool calls within one turn), so the steer lands at the next safe boundary.
